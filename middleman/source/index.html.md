# Frequently Asked Questions

### Will Fantastical work on my iPad?
Fantastical for iPhone will run on your iPad, but it is not a Universal app. This means Fantastical for iPhone will look and work exactly the same on your iPad as it does on an iPhone or iPod touch. If you're looking for the best Fantastical experience on your iPad, [Fantastical for iPad](https://flexibits.com/fantastical-ipad) is available as a separate app.

### I purchased Fantastical 1 for iPhone. How do I install it from the App Store again?
If you've previously purchased Fantastical 1 then you can reinstall it for free. Go to the App Store, tap on the Updates tap, and then tap on Purchased. Search for Fantastical in that list and then tap on the install button.

### Why aren't my calendars or reminders appearing in Fantastical?
First, please make sure your data appears as you'd expect in the Calendar and Reminders app. If it doesn't, make sure your accounts are configured correctly in the Mail, Contacts, Calendars section of the Settings app.

Once you've ensured your data is in the built-in apps, make sure you've allowed Fantastical to access your events and reminders. You can verify this in the Privacy section of the Settings app.

If your events or reminders still aren't showing up, try turning your phone off and back on. You can do this by holding down on the power button and sliding to turn off the phone.

### Why are my new events being set as all-day events?
New events will be set to all-day if you don't specify a time in your sentence. If you want a timed event, simply add the time to your sentence, such as "Meeting on Friday 3pm-5pm," and Fantastical will disable all-day mode and set the event times.

### How do I get alerts for events and reminders to open Fantastical?
You can enable alerts for events and reminders in Fantastical's settings under the Advanced settings. If you enable this option, you'll also want to disable the alerts for the Calendar and Reminder app. You can do that in the Notification Center section of the Settings app.

### Why aren't some of my Google Calendars appearing?
You probably need to enable your other calendars through Google's web interface. Go to [https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect](https://www.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect) and make sure that all of your calendars are enabled there. If you originally set up your Google account using Exchange and Google Sync, you can enable your calendars at [https://m.google.com/sync/settings/](https://m.google.com/sync/settings/).

### How do I show the date on the app icon?
You can show the current date in as a badge on Fantastical's app icon by going into Fantastical's settings and changing the App Badge Icon setting to Current Date. Apple does not allow developers to modify the icon directly, so this is the best workaround that is currently available.

### What languages does Fantastical understand?
Fantastical's natural language engine supports and automatically detects input in English, French, German, Italian, and Spanish. The days of the week and months will reflect your device's region format.

### Which types of calendars does Fantastical work with?
Fantastical works with any calendar that you have set up on your device's Settings. If it appears in Calendar, it will also appear in Fantastical. If you haven't already added your calendars to your iOS device, you can do so by opening the Settings app, selecting Mail, Contacts, and Calendars, and adding your accounts there. iOS supports syncing calendars over iCloud, Google, Yahoo, Exchange, and more.

### How do I specify a calendar or reminder list when creating a new event?
You can specify a calendar by using a slash (/) at the beginning or end of a sentence. Even easier, you only need the first character of a calendar. For example, /w or /h would create your event in the Work or Home calendars, respectively. You can be more specific if you have multiple calendars with similar names, such as /pe for Personal and /pr for Private. Alternatively you can use the word calendar, such as "Lunch with John calendar work". Finally, you can tap the space bar four times instead of using a slash. For example, "Lunch with John<space><space><space><space>w" will do the same thing.
