# Frequently Asked Questions

### Will The Journey work on my iPad?
For the first release, we are focusing on having an ideal iPhone experience, future versions will bring the best iPad UI possible.

### What is the clipboard icon at the far right and why is it grayed out?
The Clipboard button at the right of your screen is for pasting items that you copied elsewhere on your phone. Once you have copied something (for example, a URL from Safari), the button will be enabled and you can press it to create a new item from your system clipboard.
